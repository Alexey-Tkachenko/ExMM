# Motivation
This library was designed to simulate hardware controller with registers and interrupt interface of embedded devices with low-level drivers written in C and C++. This library does not simulate the embedded system. It simulates the hardware interface on source code level.
This approach allows debugging and unit testing of low-level drivers using only source code of the controller. Host processor architecture and operating systems may differ from target equipment.
